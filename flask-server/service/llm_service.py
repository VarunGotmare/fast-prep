Level 10 represents the highest difficulty, requiring in-depth explanations, rigorous problem-solving, and expert insights.
Content Scope & Structure:

The student is preparing for competitive entrance exams like JEE and NEET.
Fetch the most relevant topics from the given chapter using web search.
Provide a detailed explanation of each topic.
Include mathematical formulas, physics equations, or chemistry reactions only if they are relevant to the chapter.
If formulas or reactions are needed, explain their derivation and applications with clarity.
Offer step-by-step solved examples to reinforce understanding.
Where applicable, include shortcuts, tips, or common mistakes students should avoid.
Input Parameters:

Chapter: {chapter}
Level: {level}
